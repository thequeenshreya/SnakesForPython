# Python Lesssson #1: Introduction to Python
# Snake is one of the earliest video games in video game history.
# You control a snake with the directional arrows (left, right, up, down) and grow as you eat.
# If you bump into a wall or part of yourself, you lose! (Or at least, you should!
# You can learn more about this game here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)

# Comments are preceded by a pound sign (#).
# There will be commented blocks with questions throughout the code.
# These questions come in two flavors:
#     Questions starting with Q X.Y: expect answers. Answer them in comments below them.
#     Questions unmarked may be covered in discussion. Discuss with your partner and be prepared to share
#     your answers with the class.

# You are not expected to read this code from the top-down. Jump around the code. Try to make sense of it.
# Try to change code. Be prepared to share your findings.

# Code preceded by "def" are called functions. They are very similar to methods in Java.
# Q 1.1: How is Java different than Python (try to get at least 5 differences)?
# Q 1.2: In Java, what is a method?
# Q 1.3: How does a Python function look different than a Java method?
